---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- ✅ Git installed on your computer

### Get GitHub Token:

1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click **"Generate new token"** → **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Set name: **"Voting-Fun Upload"**
4. Select scopes:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)

6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)

## 🎯 Quick Upload (2 Commands)

### Step 1: Clean Project

```powershell
.\prepare-for-github.ps1
```

This will:
- ✅ Remove all debug logs
- ✅ Remove temporary documentation
- ✅ Keep only essential files
- ✅ Prepare clean repository

### Step 2: Upload to GitHub

```powershell
.\upload-to-github.ps1
```

You'll be prompted for:
1. **GitHub Token** - Paste the token you created
2. **GitHub Username** - Your GitHub username
3. **Repository Name** - Default is `voting-fun` (press Enter to use)

Then wait for the upload to complete (1-2 minutes).

---

## 🗑️ What Files Are Removed

All temporary files:
- ❌ Debug logs (update_debug_log.md, self_check_log.md)
- ❌ Session logs (CURRENT_SESSION_SUMMARY.md, etc.)
- ❌ Temporary guides (50+ temporary .md files)

---

## 📊 After Upload

### Your Repository URL:
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/voting-fun
```

### Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Add Topics/Tags** (on GitHub):
   - `blockchain`, `fhevm`, `zama`, `voting`, `privacy`
   - `ethereum`, `solidity`, `react`, `encryption`

2. **Update README.md**:
   - Add your Netlify demo link
   - Add screenshots
   - Add your contact info

3. **Make Repository Public** (if not already):
   - Settings → Change visibility → Make public

4. **Enable GitHub Pages** (optional):
   - Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Token authentication failed"
**Solution**: Make sure you selected `repo` scope when creating token.

### Issue: "Repository already exists"
**Solution**: Script will continue and push to existing repository.

### Issue: "Permission denied"
**Solution**: Check your token has correct permissions and hasn't expired.

### Issue: "Git not found"
**Solution**: Install Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

- ✅ Token is used only during upload and removed from git config
- ✅ `.env` files are never uploaded (in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ No sensitive data is included
- ✅ All credentials are kept private

## 📝 Manual Upload Alternative

If automatic upload fails, you can upload manually:

### Step 1: Clean Project
```powershell
.\prepare-for-github.ps1
```

### Step 2: Manual Git Commands
```powershell
# Initialize
git init
git branch -M main

# Add files
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Voting-Fun"

# Create repository on GitHub (via web interface)
# Then connect and push:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/voting-fun.git
git push -u origin main
```
